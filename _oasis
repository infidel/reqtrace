Synopsis:    Requirements traceability tool via OCaml attributes.
Description: Through the combination of indexing requiments specification
  documents (especially IETF RFCs) and the use of attributes in OCaml
  source code referring to specific requirements, this tool can produce
  an annotated requirements specification that includes references to
  the code that implements and/or tests each requirement.
  This also allows unimplemented or untested requirements to be identified
  automatically.
